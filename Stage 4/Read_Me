In this stage, data is transformed in multiple folds. 
- In the first fold, december data is scaled down based on previous month values
- In the second fold, data is trimmed based on lower bound
- In the third fold, data is normalized between [0-1]
- In the the forth fold, the data undergoes aggregation, i.e. cumulative computation.

The Modified data is used to train and predict models:
- SARIMA
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Multi-layer Perceptron

Note for XGBoost, Random Forest and Perceptron model, timeseries data are coverted to supervised learning format.
