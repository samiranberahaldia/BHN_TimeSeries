In this case, the Data is scaled in multiple folds. 
- In the first fold, december values are scaled with respect to other months, say November. 
- In the second stage, data is trimmed by its lower bound
- In the third fold, the entire dataset is normalized between [0,1]

The normalized data is used to train and predict using Multi-layer perceptron.

Note: SARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest is not used as the results obtained may be reductive.
