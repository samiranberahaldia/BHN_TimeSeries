Prediction of future sales 

Key Highlights:

- ARIMA/SARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost Algorithm have been used to forecase future sales value till December 2019.

- Timeseries data has been converted into a format, which supervised machine learning algorithms can work on.

Future Improvements:

- ARIMA or Seasonal ARIMA model may further be tuned for improvements.

- XGBoost: Iterative Learning can be employed to speed up prediction

- Random Forest is good when data has too much noise.
